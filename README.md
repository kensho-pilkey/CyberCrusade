## About

You find yourself thrown into a digital battlefield inside your own computer after a vicious virus takes over. With the antivirus system hijacked, you must defeat the virus in order to restore your computer to working order and return home safely.  Using the power of electricity, you must navigate deep into the computers internals in search of the virus. Along the way, you'll encounter corrupted antivirus defense systems that have been turned against you, as well as virus clones that you must defeat. Will you save your computer before it's too late?
